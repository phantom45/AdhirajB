                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                    <p>Today, <span class="pick">60% of the open skilled production positions in the manufacturing industry are unfulfilled</span>. Despite automation, skilled workers will still be needed to apply problem-solving capabilities, perform analysis
                        and manage production. One reason manufacturers are finding it difficult to fill positions, both skilled and unskilled, is the lack of trade school opportunities for young women and men.</p>
                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p>Through MaTrEx, short for <span class="pick">Maintenance and Training through Extended Reality</span>, we proposed the development of robust Virtual Reality training programs, offering a way for skilled professionals to train on-site
                        technicians and to perform remote diagnostics over Virtual Reality, potentially in real-time. To achieve this, we make use of <span class="pick">digital twins</span> - a virtual model of a real machine with data collected through
                        IoT devices. The professionals can use the immersive effect to explain the instrument’s working or help pinpoint the cause of a malfunction, thus making it a <span class="pick">derivative of Assisted Reality</span> powered by Digital
                        Twins. The inception of the project took place during Accenture’s Hack The Reality Hackathon.</p>

                    <h2>Implementation</h2>
                    <h3>Virtual Reality Environment</h3>
                    <p> We had to experiment a lot with the size of the VR environment and scale it to make sure it was <span class="pick">comfortable</span> for the actors and created a <span class="pick">productive learning environment</span>.
                        We built the VR interactions on top of <span class="pick">OpenVR</span> for its <span class="pick">multi-vendor support</span>, meaning that in the multi-actor scenario, there would be no restriction on the hardware being used.
                        One actor can use a top of the line Occulus Vive while the other can use a budget Windows MR and the application would comply.</p>

                    <h3>The IoT module</h3>
                    <p>For the prototype, since we lacked proper equipment, we made a functioning proof of concept by using a heat-sensor with an Arduino and establishing a connection with unity using <span class="pick">MQTT protocol</span>. </p>

                    <h3>User Interface and Dashboard</h3>
                    <p>We implemented a simple user interface and dashboard which would give actors the data in the VR environment in a graphical format.</p>

                        <li><span class="pick">Training</span> of (multiple) on-site workers on potentially different sites by remote professionals. Training in VR provides an effective learning experience by training people in the most realistic way possible,
                            without the situation actually happening in real life. </li>
                        <li>The database of these sessions can be revisited in VR for future reference. One key advantage of VR is that the sharing of virtual content can lead to more <span class="pick">robust replication and representative sampling</span>.
                            A database of standardized content will allow the training of on-site workers more efficiently.
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="pick">Ad-hoc maintenance</span> where a remote profession can review the digital twin with real-time data and provide guidance to the on-site workers. These sessions can even be recorded for a particular model for
                            future reference and maintenance.</li>
                        <li>A <span class="pick">Pooling session</span> where multiple professions get access to the digital twin and each follows their approach which is simulated and the optimal solution is implemented. Since it’s multiplayer, multiple
                            numbers of on-site workers can also work on the model or get trained to work with the necessary parts of the model. </li>

                    <p>The experiment serves as a proof of concept that <span class="pick">Virtual Reality can serve as a viable platform for demonstration training on the Industrial Scale</span>.</p>
                    <p>Future plans include conducting more in-depth user testing and analyzing their experience juxtaposed against conventional training methods.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, the team would like to explore the effect of various kinds of input mappings on the learning experience along with the possibility of the addition of more tactile elements like haptic responses to make the environment
                        more immersive.</p>

                    <h2>Impact</h2>
                    <p>One of the biggest implication of this project is the possibilty of <span class="pick">XR as a Service (XAAS)</span> paradigm. Being modular in nature, the solution can be scaled on an industrial scale. The solution can be modeled
                        as a Service that the industries can subscribe to for continual support and packaged at multiple layers based on the generalized needs of the industry.</p>
                    <p>As an organization providing this solution, there will be continual returns for the services provided. As soon as one industry adopts it, it will trigger a trend in which every industry wanting a bite of the pie. </p>
